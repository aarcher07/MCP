This code contains a deprecated DhaB12-DhaT-IcdE reaction model of PdU engineered system. Only the DhaB
and DhaT reaction is currently being modelled. This model is deprecated and now longer maintained. 

The IcdE reaction will be added later to the newer model located in DhaB_DhaT_Model.

This model is no longer in use as:
* DhaB12 reaction contains an activation step. This activationstep has not been well studied and is now excluded from current models.
* Not much is known just yet on how the experimentals on including the third reaction. 
* Of three NADH/NAD+ reactions, IcdE reaction most favours the substrates than the products at steady state. IcdE cycling reaction is not recommended for use. 
* Assumptions used to constrain the DhaB and DhaT reaction so that they are forward reactions.
