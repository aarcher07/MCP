This code contains a deprecated DhaB-DhaT-IcdE reaction model of PdU engineered system.

This model is no longer in use as:

- DhaB12 reaction contains an activation step. This activation
step has not been well studied and is now excluded from current models.
- Not much is known just yet on how the experimentals on including the third reaction. 
- Of three NADH/NAD+ reactions, IcdE reaction most favours the substrates than the products at steady state. IcdE cycling reaction is not recommended for use. 
- Assumptions used to constrain the DhaB and DhaT reaction so that they are
forward reactions.
This model is deprecated and now longer maintained. Only the DhaB
and DhaT reaction is currently being modelled. The IcdE reaction
will be added later to the newer model located in DhaB_DhaT_Model.
